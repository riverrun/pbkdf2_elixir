Pbkdf2 password hashing library for Elixir.

Pbkdf2 is a well-tested password-based key derivation function that can be
configured to remain slow and resistant to brute-force attacks even as
computational power increases.

## Comparison with the Plug.Crypto version of Pbkdf2

If you want the Pbkdf2 output to be in binary (raw) or hex format, you might
find [Plug.Crypto.KeyGenerator](https://hexdocs.pm/plug_crypto/Plug.Crypto.KeyGenerator.html)
more convenient.

## Installation

1.  Add `:pbkdf2_elixir` to the `deps` section of your `mix.exs` file:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [
        {:pbkdf2_elixir, "~> 1.4"}
      ]
    end
    ```

2.  Optional: during tests (and tests only), you may want to reduce the number of rounds
so it does not slow down your test suite. If you have a `config/test.exs`, you should
add:

    ```elixir
    config :pbkdf2_elixir, :rounds, 1
    ```
