defmodule Pbkdf2 do
  @moduledoc """
  Pbkdf2 password hashing library main module.

  This library can be used on its own, or it can be used together with
  [Comeonin](https://hexdocs.pm/comeonin/api-reference.html), which
  provides a higher-level api.

  For a lower-level API, see Pbkdf2.Base.

  ## Pbkdf2

  Pbkdf2 is a password-based key derivation function
  that uses a password, a variable-length salt and an iteration
  count and applies a pseudorandom function to these to
  produce a key.

  The original implementation used SHA-1 as the pseudorandom function,
  but this version uses HMAC-SHA-512, the default, or HMAC-SHA-256.

  ## Warning

  It is recommended that you set a maximum length for the password
  when using the `hash_pwd_salt`, `verify_pass` and `Base.hash_password`
  functions. This maximum length should not prevent valid users from setting
  long passwords. It is instead needed to combat denial-of-service attacks.
  As an example, Django sets the maximum length to 4096 bytes.
  For more information, see [this link](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/sep/15/security/).

  For more information about the options for the underlying hash function,
